# Project Overview
This project is a full-stack **real-time chat application** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and **Socket.io**.  
It demonstrates bidirectional, event-based communication between the client and server, enabling instant messaging, live notifications, typing indicators, and user presence updates.
